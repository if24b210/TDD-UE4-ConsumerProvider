            <h1>About This Project</h1>

            <p>
              This website is the result of a collaborative project between seven students from
              <strong>King Mongkut&apos;s University of Technology North Bangkok (Bangkok, Thailand)</strong> and
              <strong>FH Technikum Wien (Vienna, Austria)</strong>.
              
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Our goal was to create a helpful and user-friendly tool for planning outdoor activities in
              <strong>Vienna&apos;s beautiful parks</strong>. Whether you&apos;re looking for a playground for kids,
              a dog-friendly area, or parks that offer nearby necessities, our platform helps you find the best spot
              based on your personal needs.
            </p>
            
            <h2>How it works:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Simply tell us what you want to do &ndash; for example, bring your dog, find a playground, or have easy access to certain amenities.
              </li>
              <li>
                We&apos;ll suggest suitable parks in Vienna that match your preferences.
              </li>
              <li>
                You will then get to choose the day you want to go.
              </li>
              <li>
                At the end, you&apos;ll receive a detailed summary with:
                <ul>
                  <li>Information about the park you&apos;ve chosen</li>
                  <li>Directions on how to get there</li>
                  <li>A checklist of things to bring with you</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              This project combines <strong>technology, teamwork, and a passion for making everyday life easier
              &mdash; and it was built across two continents</strong>!
            </p>
            
            <p>
              We hope this website helps you discover new green spaces and enjoy stress-free adventures in Vienna.
            </p>
